# A.U.R.A. Logo Setup

## Required Action

Save the A.U.R.A. logo image to:
```
/Users/arnavjain/VS Code Projects/HackUTD/frontend/public/aura-logo.png
```

## Where the Logo is Used

The logo has been integrated throughout the site:

1. **Sidebar** (`components/Sidebar.tsx`) - 40x40px
2. **Header** (`components/Header.tsx`) - 48x48px  
3. **Landing Page** (`app/page.tsx`) - 40x40px in navigation

## Branding Updates

All instances have been updated from:
- ❌ "PM Auto-Pilot" / "T-Mobile" 
- ❌ "Product Manager Dashboard"
- ❌ "Customer Happiness Hub"

To:
- ✅ "A.U.R.A."
- ✅ "Automated Unified Response Agent"

## Next Steps

1. Save the cute character logo image as `public/aura-logo.png`
2. The site will automatically use it everywhere
3. The image should be a square PNG with transparent background for best results

## Current Status

- ✅ Code updated to use `/aura-logo.png`
- ✅ All branding changed to A.U.R.A.
- ⏳ **Waiting for logo image to be saved**

Once you save the image, refresh the site and you'll see the logo throughout!
